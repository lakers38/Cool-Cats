Cool Cats
This was a fun side project I did in correspondence with Part 1 of the Fastai Deep Learning course. 
I used the Fastai wrapper for the pytorch library to create a convolutional neural network
that identified whether an image of a wild cat was a jaguar, a cheetah, or a leopard. 
In the process of integrating into web app.
